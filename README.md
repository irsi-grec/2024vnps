In this research manuscript, we studied the clinical group of viremic non-progressors (VNPs), an uncommon clinical phenotype of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected individuals. VNPs are characterized by a remarkable preservation of normal CD4+ T-cell counts despite uncontrolled viral replication.
Yet, the mechanisms orchestrating evasion from HIV-1 pathogenesis in human VNPs remain elusive. Here, we implemented a novel single-cell and multiomics approach to comprehensively characterize viral, genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic factors driving this exceedingly rare disease phenotype in 16 VNPs and 29 HIV+ progressors.

## Repository contents

In this GitHub repository have been deposited the scripts used to run the [genomic](exome-seq) and [transcriptomic](scRNA-seq) analysis, and scripts to generate the paper figures.

## Obtaining raw data

The raw sequencing data used are available online:
- Raw data files from exome sequencing have been deposited at the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) database and are available upon request to the Data Access Committee (mcpuertas@irsicaixa.es, lgarrido@irsicaixa.es) as of the day of publication (Study ID: EGAS50000000079).
- Raw data files from single-cell RNA sequencing have been deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and are publicly available as of the day of publication (Project ID: PRJEB68223).
